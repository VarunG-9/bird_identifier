This is my implementation of the 'Is it a bird?' project on Fast.ai's introductory lecture, as some of the code in the original jupyter notebook was outdated (especially for loading data.)

Usage:
Run main.py to train the model. It will take 5-10 mins at max.
To use the model, use predict.py in the following format.

Run this in the terminal where the repo is located:
python predict.py file_path (model_name)

the model_name is 'Model.pkl' by default unless modified in the code.
the data will be saved in a sub-folder called data.
